#### Project Overview
<div class="justified-text">

> POS (Point of Sale) Project for Jways Services</div>
<div class="justified-text">
<br>

 During my internship at **Jways Services**, I contributed to the development of a **Point of Sale (POS)** application for restaurants. This project was designed to simplify the management of orders, payments, and inventory online, while also improving the interaction with customers and tracking sales.

#### Key Features
<div class="justified-text">

**Order Management:** Servers can register customer orders and track their preparation in real-time.  
**Table Management:** Each table in the restaurant is managed independently, with the ability to assign it to a specific server.  
**Server Management:** Each server has personalized access to take orders, manage payments, and track interactions with their tables.  
**Sales Tracking:** Managers and supervisors can track sales in real-time and generate detailed reports on transactions.  
**Integrated Payments:** The application allows for complete payment management, including calculation of amounts, discounts, and tips.

<br>
<br>

In this project, I implemented **JWT-based authentication** to secure the **POS** system. Users log in with their credentials, and upon successful authentication, the server generates a **JWT token** that is stored client-side. This token is sent with every request to validate the user's identity and authorization. The server checks the token for validity and grants access to restricted features accordingly, ensuring secure, stateless user management and preventing unauthorized actions.   
**Frontend:** **React**, for a responsive and modern user interface.  
**Backend:** **Spring Boot**, for efficient server and data management.  
**Security:** **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**, for secure authentication and user management.

This project was an excellent opportunity for me to enhance my full-stack development skills and explore the implementation of critical features in a production environment.
