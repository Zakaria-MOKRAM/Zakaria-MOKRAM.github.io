 **The Employee Management System (EMS)** was designed to provide a comprehensive solution for managing employee-related tasks within an organization. Developed as part of my internship at **DACHI COM** in Agadir, this system aims to improve the efficiency of human resources management by automating key tasks such as employee data management, leave tracking, and performance monitoring.
 During the design phase, user experience was prioritized to ensure that the interface is intuitive and easy to navigate for HR personnel.
 The architecture was carefully planned to ensure scalability and robustness, allowing the system to handle an increasing number of employees and data over time. 
 Additionally, the application was designed with flexibility in mind, allowing for future enhancements and integrations.

### Technologies Used

The **EMS** was built using a modern technology stack to ensure both performance and maintainability.
 **Spring Boot** was used for the backend development, providing a powerful and flexible framework for creating the **RESTful API** that drives the system's logic. On the frontend, **Angular** was chosen for its efficiency in building dynamic single-page applications, offering a seamless and responsive user experience.
 For data storage and retrieval, **MySQL** was used as the database management system, providing reliable and structured data storage.
The combination of these technologies allowed for the creation of a high-performance, scalable, and user-friendly system that effectively meets the needs of HR managers.
